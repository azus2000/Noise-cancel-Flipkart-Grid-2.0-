.. currentmodule:: sounddevice

Usage
=====

First, import the module:

.. code:: python

   import sounddevice as sd

Playback
--------

Assuming you have a NumPy array named ``myarray`` holding audio data with a
sampling frequency of ``fs`` (in the most cases this will be 44100 or 48000
frames per second), you can play it back with `play()`:

.. code:: python

   sd.play(myarray, fs)

This function returns immediately but continues playing the audio signal in the
background.  You can stop playback with `stop()`:

.. code:: python

   sd.stop()

If you want to block the Python interpreter until playback is finished,
you can use `wait()`:

.. code:: python

   sd.wait()

If you know that you will use the same sampling frequency for a while, you can
set it as default using `default.samplerate`:

.. code:: python

   sd.default.samplerate = fs

After that, you can drop the *samplerate* argument:

.. code:: python

   sd.play(myarray)

.. note::

   If you don't specify the correct sampling frequency,
   the sound might be played back too slow or too fast!

Recording
---------

To record audio data from your sound device into a NumPy array,
you can use `rec()`:

.. code:: python

   duration = 10.5  # seconds
   myrecording = sd.rec(int(duration * fs), samplerate=fs, channels=2)

Again, for repeated use you can set defaults using `default`:

.. code:: python

   sd.default.samplerate = fs
   sd.default.channels = 2

After that, you can drop the additional arguments:

.. code:: python

   myrecording = sd.rec(int(duration * fs))

This function also returns immediately but continues recording in the background.
In the meantime, you can run other commands.
If you want to check if the recording is finished, you should use `wait()`:

.. code:: python

   sd.wait()

If the recording was already finished, this returns immediately;
if not, it waits and returns as soon as the recording is finished.

By default, the recorded array has the data type ``'float32'``
(see `default.dtype`), but this can be changed with the *dtype* argument:

.. code:: python

   myrecording = sd.rec(int(duration * fs), dtype='float64')

Simultaneous Playback and Recording
-----------------------------------

To play back an array and record at the same time, you can use `playrec()`:

.. code:: python

   myrecording = sd.playrec(myarray, fs, channels=2)

The number of output channels is obtained from ``myarray``,
but the number of input channels still has to be specified.

Again, default values can be used:

.. code:: python

   sd.default.samplerate = fs
   sd.default.channels = 2
   myrecording = sd.playrec(myarray)

In this case the number of output channels is still taken from ``myarray``
(which may or may not have 2 channels),
but the number of input channels is taken from `default.channels`.

Device Selection
----------------

In many cases, the default input/output device(s) will be the one(s) you want,
but it is of course possible to choose a different device.
Use `query_devices()` to get a list of supported devices.
The same list can be obtained from a terminal by typing the command ::

   python3 -m sounddevice

You can use the corresponding device ID to select a desired device by assigning
to `default.device` or by passing it as *device* argument to
`play()`, `Stream()` etc.

Instead of the numerical device ID, you can also use a space-separated list of
case-insensitive substrings of the device name
(and the host API name, if needed).
See `default.device` for details.

.. code:: python

   import sounddevice as sd
   sd.default.samplerate = 44100
   sd.default.device = 'digital output'
   sd.play(myarray)

Callback Streams
----------------

The aforementioned convenience functions `play()`, `rec()` and `playrec()`
(as well as the related functions `wait()`, `stop()`, `get_status()` and
`get_stream()`) are designed for small scripts and interactive use
(e.g. in a Jupyter_ notebook).
They are supposed to be simple and convenient,
but their use cases are quite limited.

If you need more control (e.g. continuous recording, realtime processing, ...),
you should use the lower-level "stream" classes
(e.g. `Stream`, `InputStream`, `RawInputStream`),
either with the "non-blocking" callback interface or with the "blocking"
`Stream.read()` and `Stream.write()` methods, see `Blocking Read/Write Streams`_.

As an example for the "non-blocking" interface,
the following code creates a `Stream` with a callback function
that obtains audio data from the input channels
and simply forwards everything to the output channels
(be careful with the output volume, because this might cause acoustic feedback
if your microphone is close to your loudspeakers):

.. code:: python

   import sounddevice as sd
   duration = 5.5  # seconds

   def callback(indata, outdata, frames, time, status):
       if status:
           print(status)
       outdata[:] = indata

   with sd.Stream(channels=2, callback=callback):
       sd.sleep(int(duration * 1000))

The same thing can be done with `RawStream`
(NumPy_ doesn't have to be installed):

.. code:: python

   import sounddevice as sd
   duration = 5.5  # seconds

   def callback(indata, outdata, frames, time, status):
       if status:
           print(status)
       outdata[:] = indata

   with sd.RawStream(channels=2, dtype='int24', callback=callback):
       sd.sleep(int(duration * 1000))

.. note:: We are using 24-bit samples here for no particular reason
   (just because we can).

You can of course extend the callback functions
to do arbitrarily more complicated stuff.
You can also use streams without inputs (e.g. `OutputStream`)
or streams without outputs (e.g. `InputStream`).

See :doc:`examples` for more examples.

Blocking Read/Write Streams
---------------------------

Instead of using a callback function,
you can also use the "blocking" methods `Stream.read()` and `Stream.write()`
(and of course the corresponding methods in `InputStream`, `OutputStream`,
`RawStream`, `RawInputStream` and `RawOutputStream`).
