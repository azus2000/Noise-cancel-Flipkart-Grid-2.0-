Installation
============

First of all, you'll need Python_.
Any version where CFFI_ is supported should work.
If you don't have Python installed yet, you should get one of the
distributions which already include CFFI and NumPy_ (and many other useful
things), e.g. Anaconda_ or WinPython_.

      :target: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/python-sounddevice

If you are using the ``conda`` package manager (e.g. with Anaconda_ for
Linux/macOS/Windows), you can install the ``sounddevice`` module from the
``conda-forge`` channel::

   conda install -c conda-forge python-sounddevice

.. note::

   The PortAudio package on ``conda-forge`` doesn't have ASIO support,
   see https://github.com/conda-forge/portaudio-feedstock/issues/9.

There are also packages for several other package managers:

      :target: https://repology.org/metapackage/python:sounddevice

.. only:: latex

   https://repology.org/metapackage/python:sounddevice

If you are using Windows, you can alternatively install one of the packages
provided at https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#sounddevice.
The PortAudio_ library (with ASIO support) is included in the package and
you can get the rest of the dependencies on the same page.

Note that some of the aforementioned packages may be out-of-date.
You can always get the newest ``sounddevice`` release from PyPI_
(using ``pip``).
If you want to try the latest development version, have a look at the section
about :doc:`CONTRIBUTING`.

      :target: https://pypi.org/project/sounddevice/

To install the latest release from PyPI, use::

   python3 -m pip install sounddevice --user

If you want to install it system-wide for all users (assuming you have the
necessary rights), you can just drop the ``--user`` option.
If you have installed the module already, you can use the ``--upgrade`` flag to
get the newest release.

To un-install, use::

   python3 -m pip uninstall sounddevice

If you install the ``sounddevice`` module with ``pip`` on macOS or Windows,
the PortAudio_ library (with ASIO support on Windows) will be installed
automagically.
On other platforms, you might have to install PortAudio with your package
manager (the package might be called ``libportaudio2`` or similar).

You might also have to install CFFI_ (from a package called ``python3-cffi`` or
similar).

NumPy_ is only needed if you want to play back and record NumPy arrays.
The classes `sounddevice.RawStream`, `sounddevice.RawInputStream` and
`sounddevice.RawOutputStream` use plain Python buffer objects and don't need
NumPy at all.
If you need NumPy, you should install it with your package manager (from a
package named ``python3-numpy`` or similar) or use a Python distribution that
already includes NumPy (see above).
You can also install NumPy with ``pip``, but depending on your platform, this
might require a compiler and several additional libraries.
